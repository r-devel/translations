The following update was made during the [R Project Sprint 
2023](https://contributor.r-project.org/r-project-sprint-2023/), Warwick and Online (hybrid) during 30 Aug - 1 Sept 
2023:

## Guidelines

### General guidelines

- Unless having very strong reasons not to, please follow your language specific glossary and guidelines

- If you encounter ambiguous or difficult strings to translate that aren't captured in the language specific glossary 
and guidelines, refer to the core-translation slack channel to discuss it with other translators

- Some languages, like spanish, have specific channels to discuss translation. Refer to your specific channel to discuss 
issues related to your language: **if you need a slack channel set up for a language, send a direct slack message to** 
**@mcnanton**

### Rules

Translating R programming messages and warnings from English to other languages requires careful attention to both the 
technical accuracy and linguistic clarity of the translated text. Here's a translation guide to help you with this 
process:

**1. Understand the Context:**

Before translating any message or warning, it's crucial to understand the context. Know what the message is conveying, 
what part of the code it relates to, and its intended audience.

**2. Maintain Technical Accuracy:**

Ensure that the translated message conveys the same technical information as the original. The goal is to make sure that 
users can still understand the issue or information provided.

**3. Preserve Clarity:**

Clarity is paramount in translations. Make sure the translated message is clear and easy to understand. Avoid overly 
complex or verbose translations.

**4. Use Formal language:**

When translating messages for a general audience or professional context, use formal languange.

**5. Consistency:**

Maintain consistency in your translations. Use consistent terminology and wording throughout the translation to avoid 
confusion.

**6. Be Mindful of Length:**

Ensure that the translated message fits within the space allocated in the code or interface.

**7. Retain Technical Terms:**

For technical terms and code-related elements such as function names, object names, and variable names, it's often best 
to keep them in English.

**8. Handle Plurals:**

Some languages nouns have different forms for singular and plural. Ensure that you correctly handle plurals when 
translating messages that involve counts or quantities.

**9. Punctuation:**

Use the punctuation and ensure proper spacing around punctuation marks.

**10. Special Characters:**

Some technical messages may contain special characters like %s, %d, or %f for string, integer, and floating-point 
substitutions. Keep these special characters and their order in the translated message, making sure they correspond 
correctly with the placeholders.

**11. Test the Translation:**

After translating, test the messages in the R environment to ensure they appear correctly and are still functional.

**12. Document Translations:**

Keep a record of your translations for reference. This documentation can help maintain consistency in future 
translations and facilitate collaboration with other translators.

13. Seek Feedback:

If possible, seek feedback from native speakers who are also familiar with programming to ensure the translations make 
sense in the intended context.

14. Revise and Update:

Programming languages evolve, and so should your translations. Periodically review and update your translations to align 
with changes in the R programming language or best practices in translation.

Remember that translating programming messages is a specialized skill that requires a strong understanding of both the 
source and target languages as well as the technical context. Collaborating with other experienced translators can also 
improve the quality of your translations.

### What (words) not to translate

- Keyboard keys
- Function names
- Placeholders like %s, %d
- Acronyms (if they are, for example, function arguments)

### Updating Glossaries
  
To ensure compatibility across different languages,  [a list of specific terms from the English glossary were promoted to "terminology terms"](https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/8). This means these terms are now included in every glossary list, serving as a minimal set of terms for all language glossaries. If you need to add a specific term to your language glossary, you can include it in the "terminology list" by following the steps below. Please note that adding new words should adhere to existing translation guidelines, with the following additional rules:

- Do not include conjugated verbs such as "coerced." Only include the noun (e.g., "coercion") and the infinitive verb (e.g., "coerce").

- Avoid expressions with more than two words unless absolutely necessary.

#### How to include a terminology term

You may suggest the inclusion of a specific term on your glossary ensuring that it is also included in the terminology list by ticking the box on the form below. Inclusion of new terms on a glossary is subjected to approval.

### An example on the discussion of guidelines:

_Saranjeet wanted to know how to handle translating strings such as "Keyboard: PgUp, PgDown, Ctrl+Arrows, Ctrl+Home, 
Ctrl+End". She has currently translated to Hindi as "कीबोर्ड: पेज अप, पेज डाउन, कंट्रोल+एरोज , कंट्रोल+होम , 
कंट्रोल+एन्ड ,", which is in Hindi script but is spoken the same as the English words, since these are imported/foreign 
words._

_We looked at how other languages translate this string using the "Other languages" button on Weblate:_
<https://translate.rx.studio/translate/r-project/base-r-gui/hi/?checksum=05ce1e10588b237c&sort_by=-priority,position#translations>

* _French translates all the keys apart from those that are in English on a French keyboard: "Clavier : PageHaut, 
PageBas, Ctrl+Flèches, Ctrl+Début, Ctrl+Fin," According to Hugo: "keys that are translated in a French keyboard: del, 
end, screenshot, insert. I believe that other keys usually don't include text but use symbols (arrows, shift, pgup, 
pgdown). Ctrl and Alt are not translated". It looks like Chinese takes a similar approach._
* _Italian does not translate the keys: "Tastiera: PgUp, PgDown, Ctrl+Arrows, Ctrl+Home, Ctrl+End,". Most languages take 
this approach._
* _Best to discuss among translation team for specific language if possible, to decide best approach. General guidance: 
don't translate unless these terms are commonly translated on the keyboard, commonly used in other technical 
documentation, or are simply a translation of the English word into the language script. (The latter advice because if 
people are choosing to see R messages in a non-English language, they may prefer to see everything in that script where 
possible)._
